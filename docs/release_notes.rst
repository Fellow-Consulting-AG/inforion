Release notes
=============


InforION's output messages are not considered part of the stable interface -
that is, output messages may be improved at any release level, so parsing them
may be unreliable. Use the API to depend on precise behavior.

The public API may be useful in scripts that launch InforION processes.

Note that it is licensed under GPLv3, so scripts that
``import inforion` and are released publicly should probably also be
licensed under GPLv3.
