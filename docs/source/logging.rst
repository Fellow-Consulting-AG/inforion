============
Logging
============
In this section we present how logging works on Inforion CLI and API.

User can set the log level in the following way:

.. code-block:: bash

    export LOG_LEVEL = 'see log levels bellow'

Current available log levels are:

- CRITICAL
- ERROR
- WARNING
- INFO
- DEBUG

By default, it is logging the only errors, which is kind of a default behavior. However, we can change it if you insist.
